# USA Geography Matching Game

![USA Geography Matching Game screenshot](images/readme_screenshot.jpg)
## Description

A fast-paced educational matching game where players test their knowledge of US state abbreviations and capitals. Choose a category, match 5 states with their correct answers, and race against a 20-second timer!

I was inspired by Duolingo, the language learning app, vocabulary matching exercises.
